# Advent of Code 2024 🐫
My solutions to 2024 edition written in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/).

The code depends on the `Core` library, which needs to be installed in your current switch.
For legal reasons, I cannot share the inputs, but for any given day it is expected to be in `./day_<day>/input.in`.
The code can be then run with
```
opam exec -- dune exec ./day_<day>/main.exe -- <part>
```
